# Profiles, Interests, Locations

You can create multiple profiles, like "Sports", "Work", "Family", "Private". In each Profile you collect your "interests". Any interest can easily be created or you find existing ones in a friends profile. 
When you are traveling or changing locations frequently, you can add multiple "locations of interest".

That creates local communities around various "interests". Connect and participate locally with likeminded people. 
And even global communities can start to interact worldwide.
